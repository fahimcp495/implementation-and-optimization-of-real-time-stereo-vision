# Project: Implementation and Optimization of Real-Time Stereo Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and optimization of real-time stereo vision, utilizing advanced techniques and algorithms. The goal is to achieve efficient and accurate depth perception through careful coding and performance tuning. The resulting application ensures seamless real-time processing of stereo vision data, making it suitable for a variety of enhanced visual perception applications.

## Features
- **Real-Time Processing:** The implemented stereo vision system processes data in real-time, providing instantaneous depth perception.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques and algorithms for stereo vision to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Efficient Coding:** Carefully crafted code to optimize performance and resource utilization.
- **Enhanced Visual Perception:** The project enhances visual perception by providing accurate depth information through stereo vision.

## Implementation Details
The project is structured into the following source files:
- **main.cpp:** Main entry point for the application.
- **camera_capture.cpp:** Handles capturing input from stereo cameras.
- **file_operations.cpp:** Manages file operations related to stereo vision data.
- **image_processing.cpp:** Implements algorithms for stereo image processing.

## Build Instructions
The project uses a Makefile for compilation. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, particularly OpenCV version 4 or later.

### Prerequisites
- g++
- OpenCV 4 or later

### Build Command
```bash
make
```
This will compile the source files and create an executable named `a.out`

### Usage
After building the project, run the executable to initiate real-time stereo-vision processing.
```bashs
./a.out
```

### Cleaning Up
To remove the compiled object files and the executable, use the following command:
```bash
make clean
```
This will delete the object files (`*.o`) and the executable (`a.out`).

### Conclusion
The Implementation and Optimization of Real-Time Stereo Vision project aims to provide a robust solution for applications requiring enhanced visual perception. Feel free to explore and modify the source code to suit your specific needs. Contributions and improvements are welcome.

**Note**: Note: Ensure you have the necessary hardware, such as stereo cameras, for the proper functioning of the stereo vision system.
